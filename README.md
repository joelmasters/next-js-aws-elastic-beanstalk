### Installing NPM (Node Package Manager)

### Create Project Folder
Create a folder where you want your app to be stored on your local computer (either using a terminal or clicking using the standard operating system user interface).
Now you will need the terminal. Open up the terminal and navigate to the folder you created. 
Common commands:
- `ls` - *lists the files and folders inside of your current directory*
- `cd <folder name>` - *change folders to folder name specified*
- `cd ..` - *move up one folder*
### Installing NextJS
While in the terminal (and in your folder), install NextJS using `npm install --save next react react-dom`
